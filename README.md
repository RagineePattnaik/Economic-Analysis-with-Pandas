# Economic-Analysis-with-Pandas
Introduction to Economic Data Analysis

The video starts by explaining why economic data analysis is important and how data professionals use Python to extract insights.
The dataset used consists of economic indicators like GDP, inflation rates, employment statistics, and financial metrics.
Setting Up the Environment

Rob Mulla sets up a Jupyter Notebook and imports key libraries:
Pandas (for data manipulation)
Matplotlib & Seaborn (for visualization)
NumPy (for numerical operations)
Loading and Cleaning the Data

The dataset is loaded into a Pandas DataFrame from a CSV file.
Missing values are handled, unnecessary columns are dropped, and the data is formatted for better readability.
Feature engineering is performed to create new useful columns.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Descriptive statistics are used to summarize key insights.
Time series trends of economic indicators are visualized.
Correlation analysis is performed to see how different economic factors relate to each other.
Data Visualization

Seaborn & Matplotlib are used to create bar charts, line graphs, and heatmaps.
Trends in GDP growth, unemployment rates, and inflation are visualized.
The visualization helps in understanding patterns and anomalies in the dataset.
Insights & Conclusions

The video emphasizes the importance of data-driven decision-making in economic research.
Rob demonstrates how Python and Pandas can be used to analyze economic trends, identify outliers, and make predictions.
Technologies Used:
✅ Python (Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib)
✅ Jupyter Notebook
✅ CSV Files for Data Handling

Why is this Video Useful?
It gives a practical demonstration of how to use Python for economic data analysis.
Helps beginners understand data manipulation, EDA, and visualization in Python.
Provides a real-world use case for working with financial and economic datasets.
